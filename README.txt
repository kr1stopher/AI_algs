	Purpose:
		Buidling Genetic Algorithms for AI problem solving of the knapsack problem 
	Main Features:
		def calcFitness (genome): calculates fitness of a given genome 
		def (generate_genome): function provides one genome and fitness score for the knapsack problem 
		def genetic_alg():
			(1) creates population of genomes 
			
	







ChangeLog:
	10/24
		Created genetic.py
		calcFitness, generate_genome, genetic_alg functions created 
		genetic_alg incomplete and untested
